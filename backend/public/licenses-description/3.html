                    Licensee’s failure to cure the alleged breach within five (5) business days shall result in

                    recording, and the underlying musical composition embodied therein are licensed to the Licensee “as
                    is” without warranties of any kind or fitness for a particular purpose.

                <li>Producer warrants and represents that he has the full right and ability to enter into this
                    agreement, and is not under any disability, restriction, or prohibition with respect to the grant of
                    rights hereunder. Producer warrants that the manufacture, sale, distribution, or other exploitation
                    of the New Song hereunder will not infringe upon or violate any common law or statutory right of any
                    person, firm, or corporation; including, without limitation, contractual rights, copyrights, and
                    right(s) of privacy and publicity and will not constitute libel and/or slander. Licensee warrants
                    that the manufacture, sale, distribution, or other exploitation of the New Song hereunder will not
                    infringe upon or violate any common law or statutory right of any person, firm, or corporation;

                    responsibility whatsoever as to any elements added to the New Song by Licensee, and Licensee
                    indemnifies and holds Producer harmless for any such elements. Producer warrants that he did not
                    “sample” (as that term is commonly understood in the recording industry) any copyrighted material or
                    sound recordings belonging to any other person, firm, or corporation (hereinafter referred to as
                    “Owner”) without first having notified Licensee. The licensee shall have no obligation to approve
                    the use of any sample thereof; however, if approved, any payment in connection therewith, including
                    any associated legal clearance costs, shall be borne by Licensee. Knowledge by Licensee that
                    “samples” were used by Producer which was not affirmatively disclosed by Producer to Licensee shall

                    party arising from the use of any such “sample” from Producer to Licensee.

                    hereunder by the defaulting party, their agents, heirs, successors, assigns and employees, which
